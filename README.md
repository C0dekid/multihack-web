<b>Fully compatible with <a href="https://github.com/RationalCoding/multihack-brackets">multihack-brackets</a>!</b>

Tired of struggling to set up remote collaboration with your team? Try <a href="https://rationalcoding.github.io/multihack-web/">multihack.co</a>

## Usage:

1. Make sure all your team members have the same code (or use the **fetch code** feature).  

2. Upload your project as a ZIP to <a href="https://rationalcoding.github.io/multihack-web/">multihack.co</a>, or use <a href="https://github.com/RationalCoding/multihack-brackets">multihack-brackets</a>.

3. Decide on a secret room ID, and have everyone enter it.

4. VOILA! Your project is now being synchronized in real time!

### Collaborate in Real Time  

Code is synchronized in real time between everyone on your team.  

### Integrated Voice Chat

Join a secure group call in one click with WebRTC.

### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting for all web languages is supported. Adding new languages is as easy as adding a CSS file.    

Autocompletion for Javscript and CSS!  

### Export Your Project

Save your project as a ZIP archive and use it in your favourite native IDE.  

### Deploy Instantly

Upload a project with a least an **index.html** and your project will be instantly deployed via [HyperHost](https://github.com/RationalCoding/hyperhost).

You can even run Node servers *in your browser*!

### Works Offline

When your internet connection drops, MultiHack lets you keep working without interruptions.  

## Fetch Code

Press the refresh icon next to "Project Files" to fetch your team's code.

There is a limit on the public server, but not if you run [your own instance](https://github.com/RationalCoding/multihack-server).

## Run Your Own Instance

To run your own instance, see [multihack-server](https://github.com/RationalCoding/multihack-server).  

## Introducing version 3.0!

- Network has changed from server forwarding to 100% peer-to-peer! Blazing fast speeds (especially over LANs), and unlimited project sizes!

- General performance and quality improvements.
